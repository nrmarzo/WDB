          Ragnar Volarus is a Stained, the class of the strongest and
          deadliest of the Obsidians. He is the son of Alia Snowsparrow, the
          Queen of the Valkyrie and the leader of the Obsidians, and brother
          of Sefi the Quiet. He had been a slave to the Golds for more than 25
          years, during which his sister Sefi had vowed to remain silent, thus
          earning her nickname. He was freed by Darrow in Golden Son. Darrow
          explained to Ragnar that he was a Red. He explained how he was
          carved into a Gold; this caused Ragnar to declare loyalty to Darrow
          and his cause.
